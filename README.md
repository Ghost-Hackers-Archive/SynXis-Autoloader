# SynXis Auto Loader <a href="https://skillicons.dev"><img height="30px" src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,github" /></a>
- This launcher is a simple code that is designed to automatically launch the SynXis application - which has to be done through a browser, which downloads a launcher to then do so.
- SynXis cannot be opened from the system files (like other applications), it was not designed to, but must be done through the browser.
- So far this script will work for 2 locations, as far as I am aware. If your company uses SynXis, and you try this script, then let me know if it works.
